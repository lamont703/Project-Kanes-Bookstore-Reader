I have added the following features:

- **Authentication Portal:** A new page at `/login` with a form for users to log in or register.
- **Community Chat:** A new section in the Book Club Hub at `/book-club/discussions` where users can view and participate in discussions.
- **Event Management:** A new section in the Book Club Hub at `/book-club/events` where users can view upcoming and past events.
- **Content Upload Portal:** A new page in the admin section at `/admin/upload` where admins can upload new books.

Here is a list of the files and directories I created:

- `app/login/page.tsx`
- `components/ui/tabs.tsx`
- `app/book-club/discussions/page.tsx`
- `app/book-club/discussions/[id]/page.tsx`
- `app/book-club/events/page.tsx`
- `app/admin/upload/page.tsx`
